        <h2>For My Best Boyfriend Zidan Vallensky!</h2>
        <p>
            I love you. I have loved you ever since I can remember. I've pulled an all-nighter just listening to music 
            and thinking of you. I chose you, and I will choose you, over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, 
            in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you. Because you will always be my favorite destination, my home, and my whole heart... I know you can't see this right now. but i want you to know, that when you do read this, i'm all in love. You're special to me. You dont even know, you deserve everything good and perfect! with you, i felt things i tought i no longer can. I cared, i have love more than i think i am capable of. Not less, not to much, just enought to inspired me to keep  living the live i tought was hopeless. there are million things i wish i could say to you and i want to start by saying thank you. If i could have experienced anything like this with anyone, i'm glad it was you. You showed me how it felt to be apriaciated and wanted and most of all, loved. Thanks for being you. I don't think you understand how special you are. You're so precious and so perfect to me. and that's enough. You is enough cus you are all ever wanted. and this page tells one the things that i'm fall in love with the man i always love. I call him "sayang" as a sign of affection but honestly i'm addict to calling him like that. he has a good and mature nature, has good speech and always makes pepople around him feel comfortable, beautiful smile depicts happiness. Today, yesterday as far back as i remember you always on my mind and it's something i just live with. Life was so much better when you were in it. if i learned anything i know what you love means. When your heart break and it never really heals. You were without a doubt the best think that ever happened to me.
